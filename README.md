## ðŸ“Œ 1. Title
**TipJar â€“ A Simple Aptos Move Smart Contract for Sending and Receiving Tips**

---

## ðŸ“Œ 2. Description
TipJar is a lightweight Aptos Move smart contract that allows any user to create their own "tip jar" and receive AptosCoin (APT) from others.  
With just two functions:
1. `create_jar` â†’ Create a personal tip jar.
2. `send_tip` â†’ Send Aptos tokens to another user's jar.

This makes it easy for content creators, developers, or anyone to receive small payments directly on-chain.

---

## ðŸ“Œ 3. Vision
Our vision is to provide a **simple, transparent, and decentralized way to support people** in the Aptos ecosystem without relying on centralized payment processors.  
We aim to empower creators and users by enabling **direct peer-to-peer tipping** using blockchain technology.

---

## ðŸ“Œ 4. Future Scope
- **Multi-Currency Support** â€“ Accept other coins besides AptosCoin.
- **Tip Messages** â€“ Attach a short message with the tip.
- **Leaderboard** â€“ Track top tippers for each jar.
- **Withdrawal Logic** â€“ Allow jar owners to withdraw to another wallet.
- **UI Integration** â€“ Build a frontend so users can tip easily without using CLI.
